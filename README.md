# Use IAN Symbol Libraries in QGIS

* From [IAN website](http://ian.umces.edu/symbols/), download the symbols in SVG format (check [usage condition](http://ian.umces.edu/symbols/#_Usage)).
* Unzip the symbols in a location.
* Copy [IANSymbols.xml](IANSymbols.xml) in this new location. This file is a QGIS library pointing to all symbols in SVG format.
* Then in QGIS style manager, click the import from file to load all or some of the symbols.
